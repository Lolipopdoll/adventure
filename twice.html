			<pre>
Now, the color of the cloud in the sky is tropical, yeah
Red color of the sun is like your cheek
Oh tell me I'm the only one, babe
I fancy you, I fancy you, fancy you
(TWICE!)

It's dangerous it pricks, you are like a rose
It's okay, I am not afraid at all
Hold it harder, take my hand
It will be a little dangerous, even more dangerous baby

Like sweet chocolate ice-cream
My feelings melting now, so lovely
Shining most brightly in the dark universe
The star, the star, and your big star next to it

You there, I fancy you
I don't want just anyone
Hey, I love you (love ya!)
Yes, you, I fancy you
You can be happy like a dream
'Cause I need you (what?)

Fancy you, ooh
What if someone likes it first
Fancy you, ooh
I will come to you now
(Fancy, ooh)

Everyday
I can't do anything really, oh my
Mayday
It will become very serious
Bang bang
My head is hypnotized, becomes reset
What should I do?
Not sure if it is right, S.O.S

Swim, swim
I become submarine in the sea called you
Everyday is birthday
Sweet, you and my fantasy
Dream, dream
It's like a dream, pinch your cheek
Nowadays, my status message is la la la, baby

Like sweet chocolate ice-cream
My feelings melting now, so lovely
Shining most brightly in the dark universe
The star, the star, and your big star next to it

You there, I fancy you
I don't want just anyone
Hey, I love you (love ya!)
Yes, you, I fancy you
You can be happy like a dream
'Cause I need you (what?)

Fancy you, ooh
What if someone likes it first
Fancy you, ooh
I will come to you now
(Fancy, ooh)

Will it suddenly disappear like smoke?
Always full of it, I take you in my eyes
I become cozy just by thinking
I will secretly hold you from behind and never let you go

You there, I fancy you (fancy you)
I don't want just anyone
Hey, I love you (love ya!)
Yes, you, I fancy you
You can be happy like a dream
'Cause I need you (what?)

Fancy you, ooh
What if someone likes it first
Fancy you, ooh
I will come to you now
(Fancy, ooh)

            <h3>Lyrics:</h3>
            <pre> 
I'm in two minds,
In an awkward situation
I just stare and say ba-ba-ba-baby
Everyday I only imagine without asking
I talk casually and say your name baby,
But we don't even know each other
Beautiful no matter what I wear
Just the two of us in the mirror having a
Fashion show show
This time for sure, I'll be the first to talk talk
But it's only in my head, always only in my head

I start humming and before I know it
I feel like crying, I don't feel like myself
This isn't like me at all
I love you so much

Think I'm all grown up now
I'm free to make my own choices, but why
Why can't I have it my way
The more I try to push you away,
The more I'm drawn and attracted to you baby

I'm like TT, Just like TT
You don't know how I feel, So mean, so mean
I'm like TT, Just like TT
Tell me that you'll be my baby

You say I'm ridiculous,
That I don't live up to my looks
Doesn't cheer me up at all ba-ba-ba-baby
I'm going crazy in all this mess,
Why do I feel hungry?
I eat all day and am still hungry

Slap slap slap slap
The innocent doll
I sit and lie down all day,
Time flies flies flies
What's with the dull skin again
Keep wanting to just complain
Mom keeps bothering me why why why?

Nanananananana
I start humming and before I know it
I feel so irritated, I'm so upset
I'm normally not like this
I love you so much

Think I'm all grown up now
I'm free to make my own choices, but why
Why can't I have it my way
The more I try to push you away,
The more I'm drawn and attracted to you baby

I'm like TT, Just like TT
You don't know how I feel, So mean, so mean
I'm like TT, Just like TT
Tell me that you'll be my baby

Do you realize what's going on inside me
Don't disappear from my view like this
This time for sure, I'll be the first to talk talk
But it's only in my head, always only in my head

Think I'm all grown up now
I'm free to make my own choices, but why
Why can't I have it my way
The more I try to push you away,
The more I'm drawn and attracted to you baby

I'm like TT, Just like TT
You don't know how I feel, So mean, so mean
I'm like TT, Just like TT
Tell me that you'll be my baby</pre>

			<h3>Lyrics:</h3>
			<pre>
Every day it rings, the bell bell bell
Now care for me
I don't wanna waste my battery
It keeps coming, it keeps coming
Like my phone's gonna explode
I don't know, I don't know, he says he can't even breathe
He says he's struggling because of me
He says his heart is dropping, why?
He says that I'm so pretty
I'm not showing off or anything

Sorry I couldn't pick up earlier
I was meeting my friends, shy shy shy
I can't really meet you right now, sorry
I'll call you a little later

Don't beg, then you won't last long
I'll let you call me baby
It's still a little too early, too early for my heart
To feel the same – But I'll show you more

CHEER UP BABY CHEER UP BABY
Cheer up a little more
A girl can't give her heart too easily
That's how you'll get to like me even more
I'll act calm, as if it's nothing
So you won't know that I like you
Just get it together
And then baby CHEER UP

I can hear the anxiety in your voice
I can see the sweat forming on your phone
It's not attractive to answer right away
Reading your text and not responding is a given
Oops, was I too harsh boy?
I'm worried that you'll get tired
But if not, I think I'll fall for you
I think I'll fall you for even more

Sorry I couldn't respond
I was meeting my friends, shy shy shy
I can't really meet you right now, sorry
I'll call you a little later

Don't beg, I'm not going anywhere
I'll be your baby
But not too fast, show me you mean it
I'll wait for you

CHEER UP BABY CHEER UP BABY
Cheer up a little more
A girl can't give her heart too easily
That's how you'll get to like me even more
I'll act calm, as if it's nothing
So you won't know that I like you
Just get it together
And then baby CHEER UP

I like you too, I'm just worried I'll get hurt
I hope you understand cuz I'm a girl

I'm scared that you'll find out how I feel
Come to me little by little just like now
It won't take that long
Just get it together
And then baby CHEER UP

Be a man, a real man
Gotta see u love me
Like a real man
Be a man, a real man
Gotta see u love me
Like a real man

CHEER UP BABY CHEER UP BABY
Cheer up a little more
A girl can't give her heart too easily
That's how you'll get to like me even more
I'll act calm, as if it's nothing
So you won't know that I like you
Just get it together
And then baby CHEER UP</pre>
