			<h3>Lyrics:</h3>
			<pre>
I’m yours, You were mine Secrets of the world
That eternal promise was like magic
Our Scintilla bloomed underneath the starlight
Now see them burn in fire
Turned into ruins, our memories into ashes

Together together
We forever forever, you know
Our promised something something
You turn your back when the fire is burning

Crumbled sand castle, who’s a liar
Dancing fire at the end of the world
Can’t you hear it? My voice searching for you
Once again I’m left alone
“Save me”

Can’t you see me?
Like on that magical day, say “Believe me”
My heart incinerated, come and feel me feel me
Oh can’t you see me?
My friends don’t understand me, no

Can’t you see me?
Friends don’t understand me understand me anymore
Friends don’t understand me anymore more
Can’t you see me?
Friends don’t understand me understand me anymore
Friends don’t understand me understand me anymore

With resentment, my heart is heavy
Cuz you don’t understand me
To make my resentment stop, please
Take my hand, once again

Together together
We forever forever, you know
Gone in a dream something something
Abandoned island, that forgotten melody

Crumbled sand castle, who’s a liar
Dancing fire at the end of the world
Can’t you hear it? My voice searching for you
Once again I’m left alone
“Save me”

Can’t you see me?
Like on that magical day, say “Believe me”
My heart incinerated, come and feel me feel me
Oh can’t you see me?
My friends don’t understand me, no

Can’t you see me?
Friends don’t understand me understand me anymore
Friends don’t understand me understand me anymore
Can’t you see me?
Friends don’t understand me understand me anymore
Friends don’t understand me understand me anymore

Bad bad hope it’s just a painful dream
Sad sad return me to your side again

Can’t you see me?
Like on that magical day, say “Believe me”
My heart incinerated, come and feel me feel me
Oh can’t you see me?
My friends don’t understand me, no

Can’t you see me?
Friends don’t understand me understand me anymore
Friends don’t understand me any (Shh!) more
Can’t you see me?
Friends don’t understand me understand me anymore
Friends don’t understand me understand me anymore

            <pre> 
Blue hour!

I hate this awkwardness I just laugh
Baby I know we were special
One of a kind special

That look in your eyes like a gift box that’s been emptied
You and me in the setting sun
Yeah yeah I can

But it’s you
You’re the one that I want
You
Everything that I want
Blue
The blue landed next to me, everything changes
The other world at 5:53 is beautiful

Cuz of imagination
Before the orange-glowing magic
In that sky
Comes to an end

Cuz of imagination
In that instant
Can you feel the rush
Can you feel the rush
Freeze this moment

I wanna stay
(Can you feel the rush)
(Can you feel the rush)

On the boundary between the two worlds
I want to leave a trace of you and me
Come on let’s do it

I wanna stay
(Can you feel the rush)
(Can you feel the rush)

At the hour between dog and wolf
I want to be trapped in the magic
Blue hour!

You are my special
One and only special
The door of my dreams unseal
You from my memories become real

So tell me what to do
A clue to stop the sun
That you’ll smile, I knew
Woah ohh yeah

Cuz it’s you
You’re the one that I want
You
Everything that I want
Blue
Everything changes in the glow of dusk
You and me of 5:53, we’re beautiful

Cuz of imagination
Before the orange-glowing magic
In that sky
Comes to an end

Cuz of imagination
In that instant
Can you feel the rush
Can you feel the rush
Freeze this moment

I wanna stay
(Can you feel the rush)
(Can you feel the rush)

On the boundary between the two worlds
I want to leave a trace of you and me
Come on let’s do it

I wanna stay
(Can you feel the rush)
(Can you feel the rush)

At the hour between dog and wolf
I want to be trapped in the magic
Blue hour!

My time machine, dusk turning dark
I know that the end will come
The sun is down down down down down
Before you disappear into the night, I take you into my eyes

Cuz of imagination
Before the orange-glowing magic
In that sky
Comes to an end

Cuz of imagination
In that instant
Can you feel the rush
Can you feel the rush
Freeze this moment

I wanna stay
(Can you feel the rush)
(Can you feel the rush)

On the boundary between the two worlds
I want to leave a trace of you and me
Come on let’s do it

I wanna stay
(Can you feel the rush)
(Can you feel the rush)

At the hour between dog and wolf
I want to be trapped in the magic
Blue hour!

			<h3>Lyrics:</h3>
			<pre>
Seems like everyone else but me is happy
It hurts more to laugh than to cry
I try to hold it in, I try to endure, every day
But it’s not easy, right now, I need your hand

In those times, when tears come
Hold my hand tight, shall we run away?
In the hidden platform of 9 and 3/4
We can only get through if we’re together

Bibbity boppity, the train is about to depart
Bibbity boppity, to our magic island
After this tunnel, after we open our eyes
Our dreams will become reality

Be my forever, call my name
Run away, run away, run away with me
To the ends of the earth, forever together
Run away babe, please give me an answer

Tell me “yes”, don’t say “no”
Don’t wanna stay, now let’s go
When we’re together, we can run across the sky
Tell me “yes”, don’t say “no”
Don’t wanna stay, now let’s go
Take me away with the spell of us

I don’t, I don’t wanna wake up
My staff is an alarm breaker
We’re swimming through space
We’ll be the tail end of a constellation and bungee
It’s okay, don’t be afraid
We’ll be with you

When this night is about to be over
Turn back time, rewind
A forbidden game in this magic hour
A blue light will blossom

I wanna color the classroom with this sky blue magic
So the summoning spell can connect us together
After this tunnel, after we open our eyes
Our dreams will become reality

Be my forever, call my name
Run away, run away, run away with me
To the ends of the earth, forever together
Run away babe, please give me an answer

Tell me “yes”, don’t say “no”
Don’t wanna stay, now let’s go
When we’re together, we can run across the sky
Tell me “yes”, don’t say “no”
Don’t wanna stay, now let’s go
Take me away with the spell of us

On a dark night, under the stairs
The moment I saw you, the magic had started
Let’s make a spell with your tears
So you will never cry again

Be my forever, call my name
Run away, run away, run away with me
To the ends of the earth, forever together
Run away babe, please give me an answer

Tell me “yes”, don’t say “no”
Don’t wanna stay, now let’s go
When we’re together, we can run across the sky
Tell me “yes”, don’t say “no”
Don’t wanna stay, now let’s go
Take me away with the spell of us</pre>
